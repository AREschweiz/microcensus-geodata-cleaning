# Geodata cleaning of the Mobility and Transport Microcensus

This R code cleans the geodata of the [Swiss Mobility and Transport Microcensus (MTMC)](https://www.are.admin.ch/mtmc) collected in 2020 and 2021:
- It makes sure that the geodata are coherent (e.g. distances are plausible)
- It adds some typologies based on the geodata (e.g. [public transport quality categories](https://s.geo.admin.ch/91f3a3a9e2))

This code is public but it cannot be run outside of the Swiss Federal Administration, since the raw data (input data) are not publicly available. This code shows what are the modifications that are made to the raw data. The goal is to be transparent about this data cleaning process before using these data for official analysis and making them available to researchers.

A description of the geodata cleaning process will be presented at the [22nd Swiss Transport Research Conference (STRC 2022)](http://strc.ch/2022.php).

*The code will be added in this public repository soon - We are working on the code right now and still need to find time to transfer it here*
