# Geodata cleaning of the Mobility and Transport Microcensus

This R code cleans the geodata of the [Swiss Mobility and Transport Microcensus (MTMC)](https://www.are.admin.ch/mtmc) collected in 2021:
- It makes sure that the geodata are coherent (e.g. distances are plausible)
- It adds some typologies based on the geodata (e.g. [public transport quality categories](https://s.geo.admin.ch/91f3a3a9e2))

The code is publicy available upon request (contact befragung@are.admin.ch). It cannot be run outside of the Swiss Federal Administration, since the raw data (input data) are not publicly available.

A description of the geodata cleaning process can be found [here](https://github.com/AREschweiz/microcensus-geodata-cleaning/blob/main/Documentation_Plausibility_Checks_MTMC_2021_ARE.pdf).
